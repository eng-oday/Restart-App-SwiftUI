IOS App build with SwiftUI have 2 Screens (OnBoarding + Home ) with Great Animation 

- Deal with Drag Gesture and Animate Elements based on it .

- move from one screen to another one with animation .

- deal with userDefault in SWiftUi and start app based on this Value .

- deal with AVFoundation and Play Sounds based on Actions .

- build Complex Shapes .

- create Generic code and use it across the app .

- create Different Animations ( with Gesture - recursive animation ).
